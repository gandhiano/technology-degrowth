2. Who is part of the movement, who are its protagonists, what do they do and why (social stratification, how and where are they organized; which groups, which alliances etc. are there; what are the strategies...)?

It is difficult to describe who is part of a movement that is so diffuse and embedded at different levels across other movements. A few key figures and institutions are however worth mentioning.

Richard Stallman, the GNU Project and the Free Software Foundation (FSF) are probably some of the most important actors in the genesis of free software as a movement. The GNU project was founded by Stallman in 1983 at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), with the aim of developing tools and eventually building an operating system consisting exclusively of free software. In 1992, the only missing part in the operating system was the *kernel*. 

The release of the Linux kernel under a GNU Public License (GPL) in 1992, provided the missing piece to the operating system. The Linux kernel is an amazingly successful example of a convergence of global efforts: the 10,239 lines of code of the Linux Kernel, originally released by the Finnish student Linus Torvalds in 1991, has expanded to over 18 million lines of source code protected as a commons by the GPL. Its' success has been so immense that most of the internet, as well as a huge number of consumer devices - from Android smartphones, to TomTom GPS - are built on top of the Linux Kernel. Because of the GPL constraints, any piece of software built on top of it must also have its source code available. As a consequence, activity around GPL'd source code, be it non-profit or for profit, brings a contribution back to the global commons of source code and algorithms.

The W3C is a membership-based institution defining the standards for the web, while also promoting convergence of visions on what the web should look like. It is structured into multiple working groups, which are generally open for contributors to join.  The W3C aims at developing common protocols that promote the evolution of the world wide web and ensure its interoperability.

The dynamics and new cultures of collaboration brought by the free software movement extend beyond software itself. With the source code and collective dynamics brought by the free software movement the growth of Wikipedia forced Encyclopedia Britannica out of business in a few years.

Community networks supported by wireless (open source) technology such as the Freifunk initiative contribute to grassroots development of "mesh networks" and directly contribute to distribute ownership of internet infrastructure. The low cost Raspberry Pi, or other "smart devices", running FreedomBox or similar software can provide a DIY cloud service and email server for as little as 30 €, consuming around 10 Watts of power these devices fit into the palm of the hand.

A growing number of collectives are recombining and further developing existing free software into stacks that provide a more democratic access to services, shaped to needs and uses of the target communities. For example the *[IndieWeb community](https://indiewebcamp.com/)*, aims at providing "a people-focused alternative to the ‘corporate web’".

At the higher institutional level of the EU, concerns about the continuous trend of concentration of information into services hosted by corporations overseas and the global surveillance backdoors exposed by *citizenfour* Edward Snowden have promted action.  In recent years hundreds of millions pf Euros have been released under the Horizon 2020 research and innovation program to support "collective awareness platforms for sustainability and social innovation". The fund specifically recognises the contribution of hacker communities and grassroots movements and looks favourably on consortia that include actors from these communities.
