The editors of [Degrowth in Bewegung(en)](http://www.degrowth.de/de/degrowth-in-bewegungen/) are putting together a compilation of texts describing the relations between degrowth and other movements.
+This chapter provides a perspective of those who identify as being part of the  [free software movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software_movement). More specifically, the contributors to this article are personally involved in the building of digital commons as infrastructure, platforms and services. We welcome further contributions from those who see themselves as part of this open, cooperative, commons-based federation of digital infrastructure and software.
 
This chapter was built with the kind contributions of Pierre Ozoux and Jon Richter. Translation to German was provided by Irene Neumann.
