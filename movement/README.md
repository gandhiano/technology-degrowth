### About the project Degrowth in Movement(s)

Degrowth is not just a new term for an ongoing discussion on alternatives, and not just an academic debate, but also an emerging social movement. Besides many agreements there is ignorance, scepticism and prejudice within degrowth circles as well as in other social movements regarding differing perspectives, starting points, traditions, strategies and protagonists. Here, a lot of opportunities for learning emerge.

How is the relation between the degrowth movement and other social movements and perspectives? What can the degrowth movement learn from these other movements? And the other way around, what can other social movements and perspectives learn from each other as well as from degrowth ideas and practices? What common proposals, but also which contradictions, oppositions and tensions exist? What alliances could be possible?

In 32 essays, representatives of different social movements, currents or initiatives discuss these and other questions.

The essays can be read online: https://www.degrowth.info/en/dim/degrowth-in-movements/

It has furthermore been published in German, both [online](https://www.degrowth.info/de/dib/degrowth-in-bewegungen/) and as a [printed book](https://www.oekom.de/nc/buecher/gesamtprogramm/buch/degrowth-in-bewegungen.html). The English version will soon be published as a paperback book by [Zero Books](http://www.zero-books.net/).
