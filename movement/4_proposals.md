4. Which proposals has this movement for the degrowth perspective? (What is missing, which problems are out of the picture, what is underestimated, what themes, questions, problems aren't discussed at all or in an insufficient way?) Which proposals can the degrowth perspective offer to the movement?

The main historical contributions of the free software movement have probably been on the production of digital commons: source code, data, information, algorithms, knowledge. But also a whole culture of collaboration based on the ideas of freedom and autonomy, materialized in the previously mentioned global collective efforts such as Wikipedia or the Linux Kernel. We also however see big businesses using freely contributed software to improve their products, leading to increased users and profits, further concentrating attention onto their applications and platforms.

The developments and new modes of production and consumption being pushed by the so-called "Sharing Economy" also provide interesting insights into the degrowth debate. Maurie Cohen (2015) argues that rather than completely dismissing the patterns of exchange of the sharing economy, "reciprocal relationships, producer-consumer cooperatives could bring the intentions of production and consumption into closer alignment". The challenge would be to develop a "more efficacious sharing economy" capable of constraining the "expansion of mediated micro-entrepreneurship and serialized rental in favor of modes consistent with communitarian provisioning". Cohen calls for *Platform Cooperativism* as an alternative institutional setting for enabling these new patterns of reciprocal relationships and an alignment of producers and consumers to bring better value to society.

This blurring of roles between producers and consumers, enabled by technology, at the core of the praxis of the Sharing Economy, and a broad range of social businesses, leads to the emergence of a new type of economical agent which futurist Alvin Toffler called "prosumersâ€œ. Critics have expressed concern that this dynamic may contribute to the generation of new forms of capitalist exploitation, through the tendency towards generating unpaid labor, while keeping power and decision structures untouched (Ritzer and Jurgenson, 2010; Rogero, 2010). Bauwens (2006) and Benkler and Nissenbaum (2006), argue, however, that production which follows the distributed logic of peer-to-peer and commons-based peer-production may operate independently of a market logic or existing power structures.

Another ongoing debate is on the optimal architecture for the infrastructure and services being provided: should we have fully distributed (peer-to-peer) or decentralized, federated and autonomously controlled metworks. While distributed technology does offer interesting perspectives, it comes surrounded by a series of questions if it is intended to be used globally (e.g. via automated distributed ledgers, that represent a global consensus on how trust relationships should be built on transactions): who decides on the technology of distribution? How is privacy assured? How can trust between people be built if there is no institution or place where it can be attached other than the algorithms that take care of their transactions? 

Supporters of decentralization, such as the federated approach practiced by the *indieweb*, argue for distributed processes, rather than consensus, and have a focus on volition of the creators, rather than automation of all transactions. The overheads created by distributed systems at a global scale are seen as highly problematic.:

> "Systems will never scale if you require global consensus for local actions by independent agents. For example, I should not have to know where every dollar in the economy is when I want to buy something from you." (Brock, 2016)

The configuration that such new processes and roles will take will doubtlessly heavily influence how the institutional setting at the social and technological level will be shaped. The debates within the degrowth movement around democracy, autonomy, institutions and technology can certainly provide valuable insights to the discussions (at both the technological and social/institutional levels) around the typology of the networks to be built. Should we support distributed networks, where each agent is autonomous and rules tend to be global and automated (through distributed public ledgers such as the *blockchain* developed as part of the infamous *bitcoin* cryptocurrency), or should we federate communities around infrastructure, which may be shaped according to more localized rules and institutions?

Linked open data is proposed as a method to address the accumulation and appropriation of big data (the new capital) by corporations and states,  contributing to a world of massively scaled small data hosted on a federated commons cloud. The praxis of groups working on this is one of engaging in collective and federated production processes. The TransforMap project, an initiative involving dozens of networks, NGOs and initiatives worldwide, is building a federation of many maps of alternative economies. Within this process it combines network and community building and agile management practices, with events such as mapping jams, hackathons and vocamps. The goal is to develop a technological stack and an associated social process that is capable of providing meaning and use for the diverse narratives and movements emerging as a response to the limits of growth and current multiple crises.

The technology for deploying such an infrastructure is available now and at the software level it is even open. But what institutional settings could support such a cloud infrastructure to be deployed at a level that it could overcome Facebook, Google or Condoleeza's Dropbox? The focus on the technological development at the expense of attention to the politics and governance of technological infrastructure may well be one of the shortcomings of the free and open source movement.
