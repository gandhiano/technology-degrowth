3. How do you see the relation between this movement and degrowth and how can or should this relation develop within the next years? How is the relation to other social movements? (Relation means e.g. similarities, differences, conflicts, alliances etc.)

Within the degrowth movement, technology, and especially digital technology, is often taken as something to reduce or remove as much as possible from life and society. The Internet is, under this narrative, seen as a contradiction to a simple, ecological and convivial living. 

On the resource level, the provision and running costs of the global digital infrastructure is growing, with ever more powerful machines and data centers. The increases in efficiency of computation and algorithms are are prey to the rebound effect: rather than thinking the system architecture to reduce resource spending, more and more powerful hardware is bought. 

On the other hand, we live in the age of digital communication and it is part of the life - even when not directly used - of nearly every citizen in the world.

Not engaging and helping to shape the development of the digital infrastructure simply means that someone else will do it for you, with or without consent. Derrida's "paradox of hospitality" points to an interesting aspect here: the first violence a foreigner faces is the obligation to ask for hospitality in the language of the host. This metaphor has been [applied by Claudio Ciborra and Coleman to technology](http://patterns.wiki.transformap.co/view/welcome-visitors/jon.patterns.wiki.transformap.co/welcome-visitors/jon.patterns.wiki.transformap.co/resources/jon.patterns.wiki.transformap.co/federated-wiki-resources/kate.au.fedwikihappening.net/hospitality-journal/kate.au.fedwikihappening.net/first-violence-to-foreigners/frances.uk.fedwikihappening.net/hospitality-and-hostility-to-technology): if host organinations wish to absorb the technology successfully, they must learn to speak in its language and adopt the culture of the tool where appropriate. In other words, if you don't develop your own technology, you will need to adapt to the language and patterns of the technology someone else - maybe with contradictory values to yours - has developed.

Reading through some of the most cited authors on the degrowth movement, we can find strong bridges between the formulations of autonomy and the magma of Castoriadis, the anti-institutionalist proposals of Illich and what the free software movement is striving for in an internet progressively dominated by the data silos of proprietary platforms.

The complexity of the resulting industrial-technological complex is today supported by large institutions and corporations. These progressively distance its users from the technological choices and agency, from the infrastructure that hosts it, the processes of technological production and of the resource extraction necessary for its maintenance.

Media theorist Douglas Rushkoff has recently written a book describing this new industrial age we are going through. One that is no longer represented by the mechanical, huge, 19th century factory, but rather by brands, titans of the digital world, which establish their monopolies with socially networked platforms. These are presented as a spike of a late or new capitalism times: massive amounts of venture capitals are injected into ideas emerging into the digital society, with the objective of capturing as many users and data as possible, and eventually establish a monopoly and universality in the service provision: no one should get a ride if not on Uber, no one should find friends if not on Facebook, no one should find a date if not on Tinder. Still, the same Rushkoff - and along with him a few other intellectuals, hackers and activists in the collaborative economy, free software movement and commons - sees the internet as having a distributive power without precedents in the history of Humanity.

The current trend seems however to push in the opposite direction: rather than an increasing distribution of power, the internet has been progressively reduced to the usage of a few platforms, which most often act as isolated silos of information. With it, they block the core of the decentralized web: the hyperlink. The famous Iranian blogger Derakshan, writes about how after spending a few years in prison (2008-2015), he was confrontated with the dominance of the social networks and feared how these are devaluing and making the hyperlink obsolete: 

> "The hyperlink was my currency six years ago. Stemming from the idea of the hypertext, the hyperlink provided a diversity and decentralisation that the real world lacked. The hyperlink represented the open, interconnected spirit of the world wide web - a vision that started with its inventor, Tim Berners-Lee. The hyperlink was a way to abandon centralization - all the links, lines and hierarchies - and replace them with something more distributed, a system of nodes and networks.

The web with the hyperlink, represents in a way the tool in the digital world to build the autonomous society of Castoriadis, and the current threats it faces, are a threat to the emergence of degrowth utopias. It is also amazingly similar in its functioning to Illich concept of the "learning webs" (Illich, 1970). In Deschooling Society, Ivan Illich argues that a good education system should follow three purposes: to provide all that want to learn with access to resources at any time in their lives; to make it possible for all who want to share knowledge to find those who want to learn it from them; and to create opportunities for those who want to present an issue to the public to make their arguments known. 

Illich develops an example of what a learning web could be, based on a critique of the funding of TV broadcast in Bolivia, which with a huge sum of public investment managed reach only a very limited spectrum of the population (7000 TV sets after 6 years of program). Furthermore he points out how investing in TV "provides bureaucrats, whether politicians or educators, with the power to sprinkle the continent with institutionally produced programs which they-or their sponsors--decide are good for or in demand by the people." 

As an alternative, for the same amount of money and using the same level of technology, he sketches a decentralized scheme of learning: a network of tape recorders. People would be get tape recorders and tapes, which "would provide opportunity for free expression: literate and illiterate alike could record, preserve, disseminate, and repeat their opinions". Public investment would support the supply of empty tapes and of pre-recorded tapes. Reference services to objects and people (educators-at-large), as well as networks on skill exchanges and peer matching, would facilitate access to the resources the student is looking for. How far is this picture from the current tension between the concentrated ownership of social media and the distributive power of the world wide web?

Up to now, research and praxis on degrowth has unfortunately brought too little contribution in building up a coherent, critical vision on different innovations and movements that are emerging on the digital technology scene. On the contrary, there is often a distancing of the actors of degrowth from touching the technological aspects - as if diving and getting busy with it would come into conflict with the meaning of life, voluntary simplicity and some back-to-the-roots romantism that are embedded into the degrowth movement.

It is true that at the resource level, the technology of the digital age have an huge environmental and social toll. Initiatives such as the fairphone or the fair mouse just reveal how difficult it is to actually achieve a fair and ecological production of things as "simple" as a mouse for the computer. But how far are concepts such as the (fully) automated production, smart cities, cryptocurrencies, the internet of things or big data from forming part of degrowth utopias? What do we need to do, how do we need to shape them, so that they contribute towards a radical distribution, rather than to the furthering of capitalism accummulation and increase of societal dependency on services provided by corporations? How can actors and institutions related to degrowth (not) achieved in terms of getting control over the technology they use?
