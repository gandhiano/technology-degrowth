5. Vision: place for visioning, suggestions or wishes, e.g. along the questions: From the perspective of your social movement and in relation to degrowth: which opportunities do you see for the development of a strong common emancipatory social movement in the current context (ongoing crises, emergence of right wing parties, post-democracy etc.?) What should a larger social movement look like so you'd join?

An alliance between the free software movement and the degrowth movement is not only possible, but a melting pot for the emergence of new visions utopias. 

Along this chapter, reference was made to important degrowth sources, in particular with the visions of Illich and Castoriadis. We saw how Illich presents the *learning webs* as a proposal to overcome the *radical monopolies* on education; or how Castoriadis' autonomism materialize in the philosophy and praxis of the *web*. To take the words of the latter, "a free society is a society in which power is actually exercised by the collectivity, but a collectivity in which all effectively participate in equality. And this equality of effective participation, as goal to attain, must not remain a purely formal rule; it must be insured, as much as possible, by actual institutions” (Castoriadis 1993, 317-318 *cit* Papadimitropoulos, 2016).

The dimensions of democracy and justice have been equally subjected to strong focus and debate among some of the main references of the free software movement: these converge on the importance of not only having access to technology, but also on the capacity to understand and use the technology autonomously. Richard Stallman, speaking at the 2015 Chaos Communication Congress (the largest hackers congress in Europe), synthesizes the concern and awareness of the movement on the radical monopolies forming around digital technology: "teaching children to use proprietary software is like teaching them to smoke".

Collective ownership of technical infrastructures and data, interoperability, linked open data (LOD), and the semantic web with its vocabularies and ontologies are some words that are expected to appear more and more in the discourses engaged in building up postgrowth futures. As Silke Helfrich mentioned at the recent international solidarity economy congress (Solikon) in Berlin, "if you control the infrastructures of production, you don't need certification". It is hard to imagine that Ivan Illich would not feel excited about the convivial, deschooling and deinstitutionalization potential of the world wide web and an underlying commons infrastructure.

Making research projects to accumulate even more knowledge on how things work or should work is really not the interesting thing to do today. We rather need more convivial research (Vetter, 2015) in the field, capable of bringing scientists - also non-technical ones - to the collaborative development of platforms, onthologies and vocabularies for data openness and interoperability. Supporting events such as hackathons, or using (and supporting) commons server infrastructure and free software services are examples of actions that support the transformations and resistances happening in the field of technology and the digital commons.

Stallman, Rushkoff, Cohen, and most free software activists and hackers would probably not consider themselves as part of the degrowth movement. But we see a pattern emerging, which brings together (some) social businesses, the do-it-yourself culture, the capitalist-critical grassroots, the commons and free software movements. They converge on the will to (re)appropriate and decommercialize technology. They organize and often collaborate in building up Illich's "learning webs".

The web in fact enables us to come a step further in overcoming the institutional boundaries and centralization of the learning process, of which Illich is so critical. The vision for a web that provides freedom and agency to its users - and which is currently under threat - is part of the core and philosophy of the world wide web conceived by Tim-Berners Lee at the CERN. And this freedom of individuals is centralpiece to building up the utopian autonomous society that Castoriadis envisions on his Project of Individual and Collective Autonomy:

"An autonomous society implies autonomous individuals – and vice versa. Autonomous society, autonomous individuals: free society, free individuals. Freedom – But what is freedom? And what freedom? What is at issue is not inner freedom, but effective, social, concrete freedom, namely, to mention one primary feature, the largest possible space for movement and activity the institution of society can ensure for the individual. This freedom can exist only as dimension and mode of the institution of society" (Castoriadis 1993, 317-318).

The struggle for free software and the free web is also a struggle of the degrowth movement.
