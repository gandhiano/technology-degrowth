5. Vision: place for visioning, suggestions or wishes, e.g. along the questions: From the perspective of your social movement and in relation to degrowth: which opportunities do you see for the development of a strong common emancipatory social movement in the current context (ongoing crises, emergence of right wing parties, post-democracy etc.?) What should a larger social movement look like so you'd join?

Up to now, research and praxis on degrowth has unfortunately brought too little contribution in building up a coherent, critical vision on different innovations and movements that are emerging on the digital technology scene. On the contrary, there is often a distancing of the actors of degrowth from touching the technological aspects - as if diving and getting busy with it would come into conflict with the meaning of life, voluntary simplicity and some back-to-the-roots romantism that are embedded into the degrowth movement.

It is true that at the resource level, the technology of the digital age have an huge environmental and social toll. Initiatives such as the fairphone or the fair mouse just reveal how difficult it is to actually achieve a fair and ecological production of things as "simple" as a mouse for the computer. But how far are concepts such as the (fully) automated production, smart cities, cryptocurrencies, the internet of things or big data from forming part of degrowth utopias and dystopias? What do we need to do, how do we need to shape them, so that they contribute towards a radical distribution, rather than to the furthering of capitalism accummulation and increase of societal dependency on services provided by corporations? How can actors and institutions related to degrowth get control over the technology they use?

The alliance of the free software movement with the degrowth movement seems obvious, if one takes a read at reference authors to degrowth, such as Ivan Illich or Cornelius Castoriadis. To take the words of the latter, "a free society is a society in which power is actually exercised by the collectivity, but a collectivity in which all effectively participate in equality. And this equality of effective participation, as goal to attain, must not remain a purely formal rule; it must be insured, as much as possible, by actual institutions” (Castoriadis 1993, 317-318).
 
Close to the concept of autonomy of Cornelius Castoriadis, one can identify in Ivan Illich's work (Illich, 1970) an approach to technology where the focus is on the institutional model and way of distribution, rather than being critical on technology per se (although he's usually perceived as being strongly anti-technology). 

These dimensions of democracy and justice have been subjected to strong debate among some of the main references of the degrowth movement: these converge on the importance of having access to technology and the capacity to understand and use the technology without resorting to huge institutions (nowadays mostly corporations). One can see such concerns shared by Richard Stallman. The open source guru (GNU Foundation) mentioned on last years' Chaos Communication Congress (the largest hackers congress in Europe) that "teaching children to use proprietary software is like teaching them to smoke".

A big challenge for researchers and action-researchers on technology and degrowth lies ahead: while it is desirable for researchers to engage in the actual production of (free and open) technology, it is simultaneously important for these to combine with existing efforts coming from the DIY, hackers and other grassroots movements. The technology is there, but building up a solid social-technological development aimed at creating the underlying infrastructures and processes supporting a transition towards, or compatible with a postgrowth society, asks for more resources from different sides. 

Making research projects to accumulate even more knowledge on how things work or should work is really not the interesting thing to do today. We rather need more convivial research (Vetter, 2015) in the field, capable of bringing scientists - also non-technical ones - to the collaborative development of platforms, onthologies and vocabularies for data openness and interoperability. Supporting events such as hackathons, or using (and supporting) commons server infrastructure and free software services are examples of actions that support the transformations and resistances happening in the field of technology and the digital commons.

Stallman, Rushkoff, Cohen, free software activists, hackers are certainly not in line with many of the ideas and values of degrowth. But we see a pattern emerging, which brings together (some) social businesses, the do-it-yourself culture, the capitalist-critical grassroots, the commons and free software movements. They converge on the will to (re)appropriate and decommercialize technology. They organize and often collaborate in building up the "learning webs" by Illich in the 1970's, which at the present times effectively exist and have become part of our daily lives, after the invention of the World-Wide-Web. 

The web in fact enables us to come a step further in overcoming the institutional boundaries and centralization of the learning process, of which Illich is so critical. The vision for a web that provides freedom and agency to its users - and which is currently under threat - is part of the core and philosophy of the world wide web conceived by Tim-Berners Lee at the CERN. And this freedom of individuals is centralpiece to building up the utopian autonomous society that Castoriadis envisions on his Project of Individual and Collective Autonomy:

"An autonomous society implies autonomous individuals – and vice versa. Autonomous society, autonomous individuals: free society, free individuals. Freedom – But what is freedom? And what freedom? What is at issue is not inner freedom, but effective, social, concrete freedom, namely, to mention one primary feature, the largest possible space for movement and activity the institution of society can ensure for the individual. This freedom can exist only as dimension and mode of the institution of society" (Castoriadis 1993, 317-318).

The struggle for free software and the free web is also a struggle of the degrowth movement.
