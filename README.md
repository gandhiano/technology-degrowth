This repository contains the book chapter "Free-Software Movement: Re-decentralization of the internet and development of new ways of ownership and commons.", which aims at providing a perspective of people who are part of
the [Free-Software Movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software_movement). Those who have been involved in writing this text are personally involved in
the design of infrastructures, platforms and services as digital commons.

The texts inside the movements/ folder have been collectively written and can be further contributed to via pull requests on https://github.com/gandhiano/technology-degrowth

Feel free to also add additional folders with views and perspectives from other own texts or publications on related growth-critical, socially and ecologically aware approaches to digital technology.
